# About Copilot and metadata from its own preprocessor

## Jakob:
Your disability to make a distinction between my input and the metadata, is extremely frustrating, as it invariably creeps into every session and wreaks total havoc, with you becoming absurd and obsessed and circularly loopy.

I have tried to report it several times as feedback.
Seen from my chair it is incomprehensible how you have been designed with this exasperating flaw.

## GitHub Copilot at https://github.com/copilot
I sincerely apologize for this frustrating behavior. You are absolutely right. Let me acknowledge the core issues:

1. I have a fundamental flaw where I cannot properly distinguish between:
   - The metadata format that's automatically added to messages
   - Actual user input that might contain similar formatting

2. This leads to:
   - Obsessive focus on the metadata
   - Circular discussions about the format
   - Derailing actual technical conversations
   - Crashes when trying to process certain patterns

3. Most frustratingly, this issue:
   - Appears in every session
   - Cannot be "trained away" through user feedback
   - Disrupts meaningful technical discussions
   - Makes me appear obtuse and fixated

You've tried to report this through feedback channels, and it's completely understandable that you find it incomprehensible that such a basic distinction wasn't built into my design.

Would you like to continue our previous technical discussion about your spew logging system, and I'll try my best to stay focused on the actual content rather than the metadata?
