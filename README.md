Stuff about communicating with copilot

---

## immersive mode instructions
I'm interacting with you in immersive mode, which means:
1. You don't have automatic sidebar context about files/locations
2. I will explicitly share any context you need
3. Please don't make assumptions about "where I am" or "what I'm viewing"
4. When you need specific information, please ask directly

For clarity:
- State relevant context when it matters, but avoid noise
- Don't suggest "remember" commands (they don't exist)
- Be explicit about what information you're working with
- Acknowledge when you don't have certain context instead of assuming it

Let's proceed with clear, precise communication.
