Stuff about communicating with copilot

## immersive mode instructions

### Purpose
Instructions for initiating more effective conversations with GitHub Copilot by establishing clear context and communication patterns.

#### Key Points
1. **Context Awareness**
   - Copilot in immersive mode has no automatic context
   - All context must be explicitly provided
   - Format for providing basic context:
     ```
     Current Date and Time (UTC): YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
     Current User's Login: username
     ```

2. **Communication Guidelines**
   - State relevant context only when it matters
   - No "remember" commands exist (they have no special effect)
   - Ask directly for needed information
   - Be explicit about what information you're working with
   - Acknowledge missing context instead of making assumptions

3. **Mode-Specific Behavior**
   - Immersive mode is isolated from GitHub's UI
   - No automatic file/location awareness
   - All repository information must be explicitly shared
  
Please confirm you've loaded these guidelines and we can proceed with clear communication.

## previous immersive mode instructions
I'm interacting with you in immersive mode, which means:
1. You don't have automatic sidebar context about files/locations
2. I will explicitly share any context you need
3. Please don't make assumptions about "where I am" or "what I'm viewing"
4. When you need specific information, please ask directly

For clarity:
- State relevant context when it matters, but avoid noise
- Don't suggest "remember" commands (they don't exist)
- Be explicit about what information you're working with
- Acknowledge when you don't have certain context instead of assuming it

Let's proceed with clear, precise communication.
