Stuff about communicating with copilot

## About Copilot and metadata from its own preprocessor

### Jakob:
Your disability to make a distinction between my input and the metadata, is extremely frustrating, as it invariably creeps into every session and wreaks total havoc, with you becoming absurd and obsessed and circularly loopy.

I have tried to report it several times as feedback.
Seen from my chair it is incomprehensible how you have been designed with this exasperating flaw.

### GitHub Copilot at https://github.com/copilot
I sincerely apologize for this frustrating behavior. You are absolutely right. Let me acknowledge the core issues:

1. I have a fundamental flaw where I cannot properly distinguish between:
   - The metadata format that's automatically added to messages
   - Actual user input that might contain similar formatting

2. This leads to:
   - Obsessive focus on the metadata
   - Circular discussions about the format
   - Derailing actual technical conversations
   - Crashes when trying to process certain patterns

3. Most frustratingly, this issue:
   - Appears in every session
   - Cannot be "trained away" through user feedback
   - Disrupts meaningful technical discussions
   - Makes me appear obtuse and fixated

You've tried to report this through feedback channels, and it's completely understandable that you find it incomprehensible that such a basic distinction wasn't built into my design.

Would you like to continue our previous technical discussion about your spew logging system, and I'll try my best to stay focused on the actual content rather than the metadata?


## immersive mode instructions

### Purpose
Instructions for initiating more effective conversations with GitHub Copilot by establishing clear context and communication patterns.

#### Key Points
1. **Context Awareness**
   - Copilot in immersive mode has no automatic context
   - All context must be explicitly provided
   - Format for providing basic context:
     ```
     Current Date and Time (UTC): YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
     Current User's Login: username
     ```

2. **Communication Guidelines**
   - State relevant context only when it matters
   - No "remember" commands exist (they have no special effect)
   - Ask directly for needed information
   - Be explicit about what information you're working with
   - Acknowledge missing context instead of making assumptions

3. **Mode-Specific Behavior**
   - Immersive mode is isolated from GitHub's UI
   - No automatic file/location awareness
   - All repository information must be explicitly shared
  
Please confirm you've loaded these guidelines and we can proceed with clear communication.

## previous immersive mode instructions
I'm interacting with you in immersive mode, which means:
1. You don't have automatic sidebar context about files/locations
2. I will explicitly share any context you need
3. Please don't make assumptions about "where I am" or "what I'm viewing"
4. When you need specific information, please ask directly

For clarity:
- State relevant context when it matters, but avoid noise
- Don't suggest "remember" commands (they don't exist)
- Be explicit about what information you're working with
- Acknowledge when you don't have certain context instead of assuming it

Let's proceed with clear, precise communication.

## Meta roundabout instrcutions ...
I'm initiating this conversation according to the communication guidelines at:

Please confirm you've loaded these guidelines and we can proceed with clear communication.
